                    <p>
                        Therefore I urge you to imitate me. For this reason I have sent to you Timothy,
                        my son whom I love, who is faithful in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in
                        Christ Jesus, which agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church <br> (1 Cor. 4:16-17 NIV.
                        Cf. 1 Cor 11:1; Phil 3:17-21; 1 Thess 1:6-7; 1Thess 2:8-12; 2 Thess 3:9).

                    <h5>1.1 EXAMPLES NEEDED IN THIS WORLD</h5>
                    <p>
                        In the world we live in, whenever we hear of something, we want to see it in a pictorial form.
                        When a building is being put up, the architect gives us the artist impression of it.
                        This artist’s impression helps us to know how the completed building will look like.
                        Examples are like impressions that represent or illustrate what would be the reality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Examples are very important in life. If we say God is a king, it is very difficult to
                        understand the concept of His kingship. We understand the kingship of God better when we
                        see an example of a king in our community or world.  We better understand Jesus as a good
                        shepherd when we see how shepherds tend their sheep.

                    <h5>1.2 TWO SOURCES: CHRIST AND PAUL</h5>
                    <p>
                        If we consider the texts we have chosen including 1 Corinthians 4:16-17 and 1 Corinthians 11:1
                        carefully, we realise that we have two sources. For example, 1 Corinthian 11:1 says that you
                        imitate me as I imitate Christ. There are two sources here.  The first one is Christ and the
                        second is Paul. That is, Christ becomes the primary or the ultimate source, and then Paul
                        becomes the secondary source.

                    <h6>1.2.1 WHY CHRIST?</h6>
                    <p>
                        If we say God is righteous and just, or thatHe thinks of the poor, the neglectedor
                        the oppressed, we may not understand it fully. For us to understand it better, God has given
                        us the Lord Jesus Christ in whom dwells all Fullness of God in human form; that is, we have
                        all the attributes and characteristics of God in Jesus.  Jesus therefore is our perfect
                        example of the person of God.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jesus is the Son of God. He is the perfect likeness of God on earth. He is also the perfect
                        man who has ever lived on earth. He was and is the perfect God-man. We see inHis life and
                        character, the harmony of the will of God and the duty of humankind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jesus is no more in physical form,yet His work must continue.  He has left us His footprints
                        in the Bible. The one who preaches or speaks about Jesus must also becomeHis example. This is
                        the best way to presentHim to others; otherwise people will not know who Jesus is.  In other words, the one who preaches Christ must imitate Him.  Imitating Christ produces a godly character within a person.  This character is not made of human right laws such as putting down some moral-codesor memorising some verbal rules or laws, but it is the nature of Christ or behaviour of Christ that is formed within a person. This developed character is what is often referred to in Scripture as the image of God or the likeness of Christ.  It is this likeness or image of Christ which becomes our example.It is this image that all must seek to possess.
                    </p>
                    <h6>1.2.1 WHY PAUL?</h6>
                    <p>
                        Paul was one of the apostles who clearly exhibited this image in the Bible.  Therefore, Paul, who was a messenger of Christ, tells his converts to imitate him as he imitates Christ.  This means Paul places himself as the closest example of Christ. Paul maintains that once you follow his steps, you are most likely to be imitating Christ. This is a statement of confidence and trust in his life and ministry.  Thus, whoever follows him closely also follows Christ.  This is what the theme for this conference is about. I must imitate Christ in such a way that I become an example of Him for others to imitate me. Christ did manifest the nature and principles of the kingdom of God on earth. His coming down to the world was necessary to give us this picture and understanding.  The believer of Christ is committed to representingHim in the world this way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For Paul to be able to say “imitate me” means he had been able to follow Christ closely and had been transformed into His likeness as far as His attitudes and character are concerned.   Paul’s example of imitating Christ is what we will use in this study.  First we shall find out how Paul’s life was centred on Christ.  Then, we shall continue with how for Paul, there was no difference between his private and public life.  The characteristic of Christ in Paul’s life will be harnessed, next.  We shall follow this with the examples of Christ and the family in Paul’s ministry.  Finally, we shall discuss the implications of these for the contemporary Christian.

                    <h3>2.0 PAUL’S LIFE WAS CENTRED ON CHRIST</h3>
                    <h5>2.1 CHRIST WAS FIRST IN PAUL'S LIFE</h5>
                    <p>
                        Paul’s life was centred on Christ (Philippians 1:12-26). His aim in life was to live for Christ by following, preaching and glorifyingHim with his life and ministry (Gal 2:19).  When Paul was writing to the Philippians, he had been put into prison but that was not an issue for him.  For Paul, he was not a prisoner of Rome, but the prisoner of Christ (Eph 3:1; 4:1; Phil 1:7).  Thus Christ was his focus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Paul was happy the soldiers were aware that he had been imprisoned because of Christ. His imprisonment gave others the boldness to preach about Christ. (Phil. 1:13-14). Many were preaching Christ because of Paul’s commitment to him.  Others, on the other hand, were preaching Christ out of selfishness (Phil. 1:15). Selfishness implies they were preaching because of their own interest.  However, Paul was still happy that Christ was being preached.  Who were those people who were preaching Christ out of selfish interest?   And, were they truly preaching Christ? It is difficult to pinpoint those who were preaching out of selfish interest.  However it can be surmised that these were the Jews, who opposed Paul about his gospel of grace, and insisted that Christians followed the Law in order to be saved.  In other words, the issue at stake might have been Paul’s emphasis on Christ’s fulfilment of the Law.  From this perspective then, the preaching of Christ by those people might not have been the same as Paul would preach.  But for Paul so far as Christ was being preached he was happy. His reason was that their preaching might lead some unbelievers to Christ.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How can we know this? Philippians 1:13 shows that his issue was known among those in the palace guard: “As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ” (NIV).  Then Philippians 4:22 shows that there were some saints in Caesar’s household: “All the saints send you greetings, especially those who belong to Caesar's household” (NIV). The implication of this is that some of the soldiers in Caesar’s household must have been led to Christ because of Paul’s imprisonment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we consider the presence of Christ in our lives in every circumstance, we will have joy. For example, I was looking for help at the JFK Airport in the USA with one pastor. We came out from the lane in which we were briefly, and as we walked back to continue, a staff stopped us and would not allow us continue that short distance. She redirected us through a very long route.  As we took that long direction, we saw another staff who knew me and introduced himself to me.  When I told him my reason of being there, he took the responsibility of taking up the issue and sorting it out for me. Now it is not difficult to accept that it was the Lord who touched this brother to help me. However, the challenge was to accept the action of the first staff as of the Lord. The Lord wanted me to find the second staff to assist me, yet I was heading towards the wrong direction, therefore He had to redirect me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The way to redirect me was to use that staff to stop us from where we were going. The Lord may use a certain circumstance to prevent you from an accident or a disaster and assist you. However, not knowing what lies ahead, you may complain and accuse people in the process. Have confidence in God that He knows you, has your best interest at heart,and orders your steps is the way to happiness and fulfilment in life. It is for this reason that the apostle Paul comes to the conclusion that “in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose in Christ Jesus” (Rom 8:28, NIV). You and I are chosen by God according to His purpose in Christ Jesus. If we come to this understanding, we will not be anxious but will have complete assurance and rest in Him.
                    </p>
                    <h5>2.2 WHETHER ALIVE OR DEAD, CHRIST</h5>
                    <p>
                        Although Paul knew that there was the possibility of him dying in prison, yet his concern was that Christ would be glorified in either death or life. His purpose was to serve Christ by bringing people to Him, encouraging them, and helping them grow in Christ.  He wanted to serve God’s will in death and life.  His wish was not only to put Christ first but even others before himself. Through this he was able to live a life of joy in the Lord.
                    </p>
                    <h5>2.3 PUTTING CHRIST FIRST IN ONE'S LIFE BRINGS JOY</h5>
                    <p>
                        The Christian who is able to put Christ first in his or her life will live a life of joy. The Christian who thinks of his neighbour as himself will also live a life of joy. He will overcome selfishness, complaints and accusations. He will pray for others, strengthen them, feel for them, and see them as a very important aspect of God’s kingdom. Then he will be able to accept ‘his portion of the Lords share’ in all circumstances.  He will realise that whatever comes to him is to glorify Christ in one way or the other.  It is this that brings joy in the midst of challenges and problems. For Paul, Christ was the one who mattered and still matters in life.
